âœ…Project Summary<br>
Project 7: Build a Full-Stack Solution<br>
Scenario:<br>
Youâ€™ve been hired at CONNECT-E, a small agency of about a dozen employees, including three project managers, four developers, a graphic designer, two salespeople, a marketing strategist, and the director, who started the agency eight years ago.<br>
Your director, Stephanie, invites the entire agency for a drink to celebrate some good news! She has just signed a contract for a new ambitious project! ðŸ¥‚

The client in question is Groupomania, a large group and one of the most loyal clients of the agency.<br>
The project will be to build an internal social network for Groupomania's employees. The goal of this tool is to facilitate more interaction between colleagues. Groupomania's HR department has envisioned two applications for promoting exchanges between colleagues. Otherwise, theyâ€™re allowing for a lot of flexibility regarding the functionalities of the network.

Stephanie describes the proposed apps, and you realize that these are spin-offs of products that already exist:<br>
ãƒ»9GAG, because they want employees to share and comment on gifs with other colleagues.<br>
ãƒ»Reddit, because they want employees to write and/or share articles with colleagues on topics of interest to them.

Stephanie puts you in charge of the project. Youâ€™ll need to analyze the clientâ€™s needs and develop an initial functional version.

ãƒ»Build a full-stack solution<br>
ãƒ»Store data securely using SQL<br>
